header: About
subheader: I'm a computer engineer from Toronto, Canada. I like knowing how things work and that's reflected in my interests from low-level hardware to high-level software and everything in between. I'm particularly interested in good software design principles, continuous integration, hardware-software codesign and making cool things that span different domains.
